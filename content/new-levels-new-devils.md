It's funny. The gifs when searching for anything dark web related yielded nothing but bitcoin memes.. had to really scroll for anything relevant.

# Ok who are you

I `docker-composed` this persona! I can be whoever I want!

*jokes aside* 

I've been a "security d00d" for the last 7 years, and now have been given the task to build my organization's CTI program. I've worked in a few different orgs but have been in the healthcare vertical for the last 2 years leading blue team ops. I've done my darndest in the past to always keep my horizons open and remain obsessively curious.

28 years old. Husband to my wonderful wife, dog dad 🐶 (GSD), lover of coffee 🍵, golf ⛳, MMO's ☠️, and shred 🎸. My "safe spaces" when it comes to languages are PowerShell 💡and Python 🐍. I want to pick a 3rd to round myself out, leaning towards Rust ⚠️ 

# What is to be expected from this page?

Beats me! I plan to put some of my personal research on this page, expect the first CTI related content late Q1 2024 after the holidays and my 90 day deliverables for the new gig.  I'm super pumped to start this journey and I'll be diving in by ingesting the ***absolute fuck ton*** of content that's already in the world today. I've lurked, poked, and proded up to now, but never to the degree this new endeavor will require of me. I have some catch-up to do so that I can have a firm understanding of where I can add new value in a very ✨busy✨ space. Until then, this is my long commit message for this blog :kek
